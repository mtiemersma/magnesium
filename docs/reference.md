# Introduction

This file contains the neccesary documentation to get started with the language,
and also serves as a reference to the language.

This document is not here to teach you basic programming concepts, but may occasionally
go into more depth when that is considered neccesary.

# Basic concepts

Code blocks in this language consist of expressions and statements.
All statements are expressions but not all expressions ar statements.
Expressions are pieces of code that return any value.
Statements always return the unit type.

In this language there is the concept of moving versus copying like in rust and cpp.
Moving here means that a value becomes inaccesible after it has been moved. and copying
means that a value is retained and the copied version exists alongside it.
