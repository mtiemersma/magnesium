Builtin types
=============

Number types
------------

Note that not all of these types may be available on all platforms. We will 
try to emulate the types in software if that is enabled.

- ``u8, u16, u32, u64, u128``: unsigned integers, the suffix indicates bit count
- ``i8, u16, i32, i64, i128``: signed integers, the suffix indicates bit count
- ``f16, f32, f64, f80, f128, f256``: IEEE 754 floating point formats
- ``d32, d64, d128``: IEEE 754 decimal floating point format
